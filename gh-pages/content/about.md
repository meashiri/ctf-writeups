I have always enjoyed solving puzzles and problems based in mathematics. It was natural to gravitate towards CTFs, even though I don't have a structured exposure to Cyber Security. It is tangentially related to my job, but I enjoy learning about it every single time. 

This is a site that grew out my need to keep notes on the CTF challenges I have attempted and perhaps solved. Initially I was storing my notes into a private repo on Github. But once I realized the convenience of Github Pages, it was a no-brainer to create a public-facing version, so that I can have access to it on the go. It also helps in these other aspects: 

* Be a [Rubber Ducky of sorts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)

Explaining your thought process and problems to others - even if inanimate objects - provides a good structure for creative problem solving and enhancing understanding of foundational concepts.  I try to explain my thought process as it is one way for me to cement the learning and also to insure that it still makes sense when I read it several months down the road. 

* Collect unique approaches to solving the problem 

As with any problem solving, there are essentially unlimited number of approaches and solutions. Seeing how someone may have approached the problem that I have struggled with is a unique learning experience.

* Be a quick go-to collection of techniques, code-snippets and solutions

In most cases, I try to solve solve the problem from the ground-up atleast once. It is not a whole lot of fun to just run a prebuilt utility and get to the flag, even though it is expedient, I prefer to learn how that approach works. 

It is cool to see people from all over the world reading this site.
